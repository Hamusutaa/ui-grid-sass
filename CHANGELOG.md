## CHANGE LOG
#### 23 February, 2018
Breaking changes. Completely removes the Bootstrap and Font Awesome code from
the compiled output. Solidifies styling based upon styles provided in:
- Boostrap-SASS@3.3.7 (final)
- Font-Awesome@4.7.0
Both of these dependencies are the final versions in those major releases, as the next
major release of each are complete rewrites of their respective libraries, and UI-Grid 
for AngularJS (1.x) is written for these versions.
